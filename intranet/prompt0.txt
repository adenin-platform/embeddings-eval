I need a list of the content which should be in the intranet of a mid sized consumer packaged goods company as a json file. The list should contain the 200 most important tools, and documents. For each entry I need an unique id as int, a title, an url, a type like document, manual, app, link, tool, audience (like managers, new hires, sales agents), owner email, It should then also contain a 2-3 sentences description of the entry which should help new employees to find the url without knowing the exact title. when it's an external tool (like jira) there should also be a link to the vendor. the result should be a json file. be sure that the file is correctly escaped, especially description. audience should always be an array, also when audience is just one value. be sure to include all 200 not just a subset! be sure to not return any duplicates!
